-- Questions:

-- 1. How many customers are in each city? Your solution should include the city name and the number of customers sorted from highest to lowest.

SELECT city, COUNT(*) as num_customers 
FROM sale.customer
GROUP BY city
ORDER BY num_customers DESC;

-- 2. Find the total product quantity of the orders. Your solution should include order ids and quantity of products.

SELECT order_id, SUM(quantity) tot_quant
FROM sale.order_item
GROUP BY order_id;

-- 3. Find the first order date for each customer_id.

SELECT customer_id, MIN(order_date) first_order_date
FROM sale.orders
GROUP BY customer_id


-- 4. Find the total amount of each order. Your solution should include order id and total amount sorted from highest to lowest.

SELECT order_id, SUM(list_price * quantity - discount) total_amount
FROM sale.order_item
GROUP BY order_id
ORDER BY total_amount DESC;

-- 5. Find the order id that has the maximum average product price. Your solution should include only one row with the order id and average product price

SELECT TOP 1 order_id, AVG(list_price) AS avg_pro_price
FROM sale.order_item
GROUP BY order_id
ORDER BY avg_pro_price DESC;


-- 6. Write a query that displays brand_id, product_id and list_price sorted first by brand_id (in ascending order), and then by list_price (in descending order).

SELECT brand_id, product_id, list_price
FROM product.product
ORDER BY brand_id ASC, list_price DESC;

-- 7. Write a query that displays brand_id, product_id and list_price, but this time sorted first by list_price (in descending order), and then by brand_id (in ascending order).

SELECT brand_id, product_id, list_price
FROM product.product
ORDER BY list_price DESC, brand_id ASC;

-- 8. Compare the results of these two queries above. How are the results different when you switch the column you sort on first? (Explain it in your own words.)

/*
ilk statement de �nce kategorik bir de�i�ken olan brand_id ye g�re s�ralama yap�p numerik de�i�ken olan list_price brand_id ye ba�l� olarak azalan �eklinde s�raland�. Beklenen bir s�ralama g�zlendi. Ancak ikinci statement te s�ralama numerik de�i�ken olan list_price g�re yap�l�nca brand_id deki hiyerar�ik yap� bozuldu ve tablonun anla��lmas� zorla�t�. Galiba s�ralama yap�l�rken kategorik, numerik ayr�m�na dikkat edilip s�ralam yap�l�rsa daha anla��l�r tablo elde edilir.
